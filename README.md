# P10 LED Matrix Display

## Overview

This project is developed as part of the **IN4300 Embedded Systems** module. The goal is to build an IoT-based system that can display prices on three **P10 LED matrix displays**. The prices are fetched from a web application, which provides a facility for manual input of values.

### Project Description

Supermarkets frequently update prices due to promotions, supply chain changes, and demand fluctuations. Traditional price updates require manual labor, making the process time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to develop a **real-time, dynamic price display system** using P10 LED panels, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency. Prices are entered via a web application and displayed wirelessly on LED matrices through an embedded system.

## Features

✅ **Real-time Price Display** – Fetches and updates prices dynamically.\
✅ **Three P10 LED Matrix Panels** – Displays values across multiple screens.\
✅ **Web Application Integration** – Allows manual input of prices.\
✅ **Embedded System Implementation** – Utilizes microcontrollers for control and communication.

## System Architecture

1. **Web Application**:
   - Interface for entering and updating prices.
   - Sends data to the microcontroller via API.
2. **Embedded System**:
   - Fetches price data from the web app.
   - Controls P10 LED Matrix modules.
3. **Display Mechanism**:
   - Updates values dynamically on LED matrices.

### System Workflow

📌 **Web App:** Staff inputs prices into the system.\
📌 **Database:** Prices are stored in MySQL/Firebase.\
📌 **ESP8266:** Retrieves updated prices via Wi-Fi.\
📌 **Arduino Mega:** Processes and sends data to LED panels.\
📌 **P10 LED Panels:** Dynamically display prices in real time.
